This is the boilerplate from which I will create basic React projects. Intended for use of Free Code Campers, but of course anyone is free to use it.

I created this boilerplate with instructions from the book [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com). 

Then, I used the latest from Dan Abramov's [React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/reacthotboilerplate).

Then, I did something uncanny and read [the docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html) as well as watched [the videos](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-presentational-components-todo-todolist). Then I went through the [Immutable JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) docs and this handy [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-todo-app-using-react-redux-and-immutable-js/) tutorial on combining Immutable JS with Redux. 

## Features

- Hot reloading
- Redux
- Immutable JS
- Github pages deployment
- Sass

## Instructions for use

### Install dependencies:

```		
npm install
```		

### Run the server:

```
npm start
```

### Open the page:
```
localhost:8000
```

Try changing things around in `App.jsx` or `main.sass`

To deploy to github, fork your own, then run:

```
npm run deploy
```
